                        We live in an old mining area, which means all of the houses in the neighbourhood are built the exact same way. However, the previous owner transformed the first floor of the house to make the living-room bigger, and upstairs to go from three bedrooms to two, the master bedroom having a walk-in closet. We love our space downstairs as it is open and quite large. There are however a few changes we would like to make in the future.

                        Downstairs, we would like to increase out window space as very little light comes in the living room and leaves quite dark, especially in winter. We would also like to bring down the conservatory. It is very poorly built and useable only a couple of months a year, the rest of the time it is either an oven or a freezer. This would diminish the useable space inside. To compensate for that, an extension to the kitchen would likely be built, enabling us at the same time to put a toilet downstairs.

                        The living room, as the rest of the house, had carpet. Typical of English homes you will say. Indeed! But a few problems. One, we have quite a few pets, which means no carpet will live very long in our house. Two, the carpet that is in the house is a special “fancy” type of carpet that looks like brown rope and is literally impossible to clean! For our safety and health, we decided to rip everything off in the living room.

                        Instead of carpet, we went with vinyl flooring. This is amazing as it looks very nice with its wood effect but mostly, it is easy to clean! A brush and a mop and all set to have an amazing looking floor. We did have to invest in good quality floors as it needs to resist the to-and-fro of two humans, two cats and one 75-pound dog.

                            The bathroom was fitted with a bathtub and nothing else, not even a shower head and a curtain! As soon as we walked in the house, we started looking for a contractor that would be able to help us out. We decided to go for a shower to save time, money and water. We wanted to have an Italian style shower, with the shower tray level to the floor. Unfortunately, due to piping design and the fact that our shower is located just above the entrance, we had to make a step. We are very happy with the change and with the shower. It is a nice big shower, and it feels like standing under a warm rain which is lovely and relaxing.
